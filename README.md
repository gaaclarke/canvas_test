# canvas_test

A minimal Flutter project for testing Canvas.

## Getting Started

This can be helpful for reproducing `engine` bugs or seeing the difference
between Impeller and Skia.

Before building for a platform it needs to be added with `flutter create`.  For
example, this is how iOS is added:

```sh
flutter create . --platforms=ios --no-overwrite
```
